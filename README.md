## Restaurant Order App
An app similar to Zomato and Swiggy which takes up your Location (Latitude & Longitude) shows you places nearby and lets you order from it but instead of delivery the user have to pickup the order. Hence no more queue. 

Was my failed attempt at creating a app which will solve the problem of queues in QSR's. 

## Tech Stack
